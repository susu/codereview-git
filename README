Some codereview stuff with git
==============================

  * You can generate two-sided diff from a git repo
  * for license see COPYING

  * If there is 'staged' files in the repo, the diff generated from 'staged' vs HEAD
  * If there is no staged files, the diff generated fomr HEAD^ vs HEAD


git-codereview.sh needs codediff.py from this project:
